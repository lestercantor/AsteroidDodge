# AsteroidDodge
 A little game I made using the Godot engine

I used [itch.io](https://itch.io/) to upload the game and host it on the browser as it is lightweight. The link to the game can be found [here](https://magic497.itch.io/asteroid-dodge)

_I forgot to make a repository for this mini project at the very start to keep track of the progress and commits, so I have just uploaded the source code and assets now._

## Some of the features that I looked up 
- The player [explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IxwZgepCdY)
- [Fade in/out transition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Shj_QVwrefY)
- [Infinite scrolling background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsX2PRUNXI)

These were nice to have, but not necessary, features to add a bit of life to the game.
